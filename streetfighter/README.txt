A Pen created at CodePen.io. You can find this one at http://codepen.io/jkneb/pen/smtHA.

 Make Ken walk / punch / kick / jump / etc. with your keyboard. I assigned portions of png sprites to css class names, then added some css animations in it and finally used simple JS events to add / remove them on Ken.
